## Environment setup <a id="env_setup"/>

### Basic Setup (Also required by some other Group 10 repos)

**Step 1. Create virtual environment using anaconda**

```
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.8 -y
conda activate open-mmlab
```

*Please make sure that you are create a virtual env with python version 3.8*

**Step 2 Install Pytorch from wheel**

```
wget https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu110/torch-1.7.1%2Bcu110-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl#sha256=709cec07bb34735bcf49ad1d631e4d90d29fa56fe23ac9768089c854367a1ac9
pip install torch-1.7.1+cu110-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```

*Please double check that you install the correct version of pytorch using the following command*

![Output if correct pytorch version is installed](./check_torch.png)

**Step 3 Install cudatoolkit via conda-forge channel**

*You must be on the GPU compute node to install cudatoolkit and mmcv since GCC compiler and CUDA drivers only available on GPU computing nodes*

```
gpu-interactive
conda activate open-mmlab
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.0
```

**Step 4 Install torchvision, mmcv-full and mmcls package using pip**

*Make sure you are on GPU compute node!!*

- `gpu-interactive`

*Make sure you did not previously installed any relevant package*
*Following pip show command show output a message like "no such package found"*

```
pip show torchvision
pip show mmcv
pip show mmcv-full
pip show mmcls
```

*remove pip cache*

```
pip cache remove torchvision
pip cache remove mmcv
pip cache remove mmcv-full
pip cache remove mmcls
```

*install packages*

```
pip install torchvision==0.8.2
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.14 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu110/torch1.7.0/index.html
```

## Introduction

mmfewshot is an open source few shot learning toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://open-mmlab.github.io/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.
The compatibility to earlier versions of PyTorch is not fully tested.

### Major features

- **Support multiple tasks in Few Shot Learning**

  MMFewShot provides unified implementation and evaluation of few shot classification and detection.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the few shot learning framework into different components,
  which makes it much easy and flexible to build a new model by combining different modules.

- **Strong baseline and State of the art**

  The toolbox provides strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods in few shot classification and detection.

## What's New

v0.1.0 was released in 24/11/2021.
Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/en/changelog.md) for details and release history.

## Installation & Dataset Preparation
